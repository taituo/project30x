# Open Questions & Next Steps

1. Validate the Docusaurus site by installing dependencies, running the dev server, and confirming sidebar navigation works as expected.
2. Define owners and delivery sequencing for the 30 projects to align with the weekly schedule in the master plan.
3. Establish CI/CD workflows for the documentation site (build + deploy) and ensure Algolia DocSearch or equivalent search integration is configured.
4. Determine the scaffolding approach and templates each project should adopt before coding begins, including shared packages and infrastructure baselines.
5. Plan the ADR template and review cadence so architecture decisions stay synchronized with the new specs.
6. Identify the teams or agents responsible for maintaining the security pipeline, observability suite, and research logs as implementations move forward.
