# Open Questions & Next Steps

1. Install dependencies under `docs/` and verify the site locally with `npm run start`, followed by a production build check via `npm run build`.
2. Set up a GitHub Pages deployment workflow (branch `gh-pages`, Actions job, custom domain if needed) and validate the publish step.
3. Define reusable scaffolding templates for the app directories (CLI, SaaS, enterprise) covering lint/test, CI, and IaC baselines.
4. Finalise the ADR template and review cadence so architectural decisions remain traceable as implementation begins.
5. Assign ownership for shared capabilities (security pipeline, observability suite, research logs) and document the operating agreements.
