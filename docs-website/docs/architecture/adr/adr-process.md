title: ADR Workflow
---

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture irreversible decisions with their context and consequences. The Softa 2025 workflow is:

1. Write a draft ADR in `docs/architecture/adr/` using the shared template.
2. Submit a pull request for async review, capturing rationale and dissent.
3. Merge once consensus is reached; merged ADRs become immutable history.
