The platform layer consolidates shared services—CI/CD, infrastructure as code, security tooling, and observability stacks—that every project consumes. Reusable workflows, Terraform modules, and Helm/Kustomize templates live in the monorepo and enforce consistent environments across Vercel previews, the self-hosted VM, and managed cloud clusters.
