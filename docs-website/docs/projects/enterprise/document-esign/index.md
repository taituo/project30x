# Context

Enable enterprises to handle document signing with cryptographic guarantees and regulatory compliance.

## Objectives

### Must
- Support document upload, template management, and signer workflows
- Generate tamper-evident audit trails with timestamping and hash chaining
- Integrate with storage backends (S3 or GCS) and KMS for encryption

### Should
- Provide signer authentication options such as email OTP or OAuth
- Support multi-signer routing and reminders

### Won't
- Offer long-term digital certificate management beyond baseline
- Provide offline paper digitization services

## Architecture Outline

- Backend in Node or Rust managing signing sessions and audit logs
- React UI for template setup, signer flows, and tracking dashboards
- Timestamping service integrating with RFC 3161 authority or blockchain anchor

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Audit dashboards tracking signature completion, declines, and verification checks
- Security monitoring for anomalous access patterns and tampering attempts

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Legal non-compliance in target regions** — Engage legal review and align with eIDAS/UETA requirements
- **Document tampering or key compromise** — Use KMS-managed keys, regular rotation, and signatures stored with verification metadata

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Implement core signing workflow with audit logging and secure storage
- Deliver UI for template creation and signer progress tracking

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add multi-signer routing, authentication methods, and reminders
- Integrate timestamp authority and compliance reporting

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Offer contract analytics and clause extraction
- Provide integration marketplace with CRM and ERP connectors
