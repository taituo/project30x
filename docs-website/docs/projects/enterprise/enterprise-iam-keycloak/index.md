# Context

Provide enterprise-ready IAM baseline with tenant isolation, federation, and auditability.

## Objectives

### Must
- Deploy Keycloak with automation for realm provisioning and configuration
- Integrate with SCIM or API for user and group lifecycle management
- Expose admin UI and APIs for managing client apps and policies

### Should
- Implement per-tenant branding and login flows
- Provide audit logging, backup, and disaster recovery playbooks

### Won't
- Replace full-fledged governance or risk compliance suites
- Guarantee support for proprietary identity providers without adapters

## Architecture Outline

- Helm deployment of Keycloak with Postgres backend and operator for lifecycle
- Automation scripts using Terraform or Ansible for tenant provisioning
- Integration adapters for OAuth2/OIDC clients and external identity providers

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Dashboards for login success/failure rates and latency
- Audit logs stored with retention policies and alerting on anomalies

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Misconfiguration exposes tenants to each other** — Enforce automated tests that validate realm isolation and RBAC policies
- **Operational complexity overwhelms teams** — Provide opinionated automation scripts, runbooks, and training materials

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Automate Keycloak deployment with baseline tenant provisioning
- Document integration steps for sample applications

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add SCIM synchronization, audit logging, and backup procedures
- Implement branded login flows and monitoring dashboards

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Offer delegated administration and advanced policy packs
- Integrate with external compliance tooling and SIEM feeds
