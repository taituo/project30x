The Softa 2025 program enforces a unified operating model across every project. Key pillars include:

- **Docs-as-code**: every change ships with updated specs, ADRs, and checklists.
- **Golden path tooling**: shared lint, test, security, and observability pipelines must pass before merge.
- **AI-augmented delivery**: agent workflows assist with specs, scaffolding, testing, and reviews, but humans own final decisions.
- **Definition of done**: buildable code, clean quality gates, security scans, observability, demo walkthrough, and ADR coverage.
