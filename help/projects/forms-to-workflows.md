# Context

Help operations teams automate repetitive tasks by connecting form inputs to rules-driven workflow executions.

## Objectives

### Must
- Model workflow definitions with triggers, tasks, and conditionals
- Provide builder UI and audit-friendly execution logs
- Offer connectors for email, webhooks, and common SaaS targets

### Should
- Include versioning for workflows with safe rollbacks
- Support human-in-the-loop approval steps

### Won't
- Deliver full marketplace of third-party integrations at launch
- Guarantee ultra-low latency for long-running workflows

## Architecture Outline

- TypeScript backend leveraging Temporal/Temporalite for workflow orchestration
- Next.js UI using shared design system and real-time status updates
- Connector SDK enabling community-driven integrations

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Workflow execution metrics tracing task durations and failure ratios
- Structured audit logs correlating user actions and workflow state

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Complex workflows create runaway costs** — Enforce quotas and provide cost estimates before activation
- **Connector secrets compromised** — Store secrets with SOPS and rotate automatically via external secret store

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Implement workflow engine with core connectors and builder UI
- Deliver execution history view with retry controls

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add approvals, versioning, and advanced connectors
- Instrument metrics/dashboards and automate alerting

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Publish template library and marketplace concept
- Expose public APIs and CLI for workflow management
