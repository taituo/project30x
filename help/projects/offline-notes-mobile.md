# Context

Deliver reliable mobile note taking with conflict resolution and optional end-to-end encryption for privacy-sensitive teams.

## Objectives

### Must
- Implement React Native client with offline storage and sync engine
- Provide sync server handling conflict resolution and delta exchange
- Support user authentication and device registration flows

### Should
- Enable optional end-to-end encryption per notebook
- Offer desktop or web client using shared sync logic

### Won't
- Provide full document collaboration with simultaneous editing
- Implement complex rich-text editors at launch

## Architecture Outline

- React Native app using SQLite/WatermelonDB and state machines for sync lifecycle
- Rust or Node sync server exposing delta-based APIs with CRDT strategies
- Push notification service for change hints and background sync

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Client telemetry on sync success, conflicts, and latency
- Server metrics tracking per-tenant storage and request timings

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Conflict resolution bugs cause data loss** — Adopt CRDT-based approach and include extensive merge simulations
- **Encryption handling complicates UX** — Design clear onboarding and key recovery flows with security reviews

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Build mobile client with offline CRUD and basic sync server
- Implement authentication and conflict resolution strategy

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add encryption option, desktop/web client, and telemetry dashboards
- Improve UX with background sync and conflict resolution UI

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Implement collaborative sessions with shared cursors
- Integrate AI summarization and search across notebooks
