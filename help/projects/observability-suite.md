# Context

Provide a reusable platform blueprint for observability that teams can adopt with minimal configuration.

## Objectives

### Must
- Deploy observability stack via Helmfile or Kustomize with secure defaults
- Offer dashboards for traces, logs, metrics, and SLO calculations
- Include runbooks and alerts for platform health

### Should
- Support multi-tenant namespaces with RBAC
- Provide Terraform modules for cloud deployment

### Won't
- Replace enterprise-specific monitoring tools like Datadog
- Guarantee storage scalability beyond reference sizes

## Architecture Outline

- Helm/Kustomize overlays deploying Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Grafana, and OTel collector
- SLO calculator service exposing APIs and UI components
- GitOps pipeline for configuration synchronization

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Meta-monitoring dashboards tracking ingestion rates, queue depth, and scrape errors
- Alerting policies for SLO burn rate and platform saturation

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Resource intensive components overload clusters** — Define sizing guides and autoscaling policies with guardrails
- **Upgrades break compatibility** — Use canary environments and automated smoke tests for Helm releases

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Deploy base stack on kind and document instrumentation onboarding
- Ship default dashboards and alert templates

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add multi-tenant RBAC, Terraform modules, and GitOps automation
- Integrate SLO calculator UI with sample services

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Support multi-cluster federation and long-term storage backends
- Add cost monitoring and capacity planning tools
