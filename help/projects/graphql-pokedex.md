# Context

Illustrate GraphQL best practices—from schema design to client caching—using a playful dataset that teams can extend.

## Objectives

### Must
- Expose GraphQL schema with types for species, abilities, and moves
- Implement dataloaders to avoid N+1 queries against upstream APIs
- Ship client demonstrating queries, mutations, and caching patterns

### Should
- Provide persisted queries for common client operations
- Offer schema documentation and a playground with auth guards

### Won't
- Build a production-grade battle simulator
- Implement complex competitive meta analytics

## Architecture Outline

- Apollo Server with REST data sources cached locally
- Apollo Client or Urql front-end leveraging normalized cache and optimistic updates
- Schema federation hooks for future modular subgraphs

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Tracing resolvers to surface slow fields and caching misses
- Contract tests ensuring schema compatibility across releases

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Upstream API instability** — Mirror critical data locally and implement retry/backoff strategies
- **Cache invalidation bugs** — Adopt versioned keys and integration tests around cache refresh flows

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Model core schema, hook to public API, and deliver base React client
- Add dataloaders and tests covering common query paths

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Introduce persisted queries, caching diagnostics, and docs
- Add auth guards for write operations and rate limiting

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Demonstrate schema federation with a stats subgraph
- Publish GraphQL schema registry integration for breaking-change checks
