# Context

Provide a self-hostable alternative to commercial flag services with strong governance, SDK support, and analytics.

## Objectives

### Must
- Expose APIs for flag definitions, targeting rules, and evaluations
- Offer official SDKs or shims for TypeScript, Rust, and Python clients
- Ensure tenant isolation with RBAC, audit logging, and rate limits

### Should
- Provide UI for experiment rollout, metrics, and flag lifecycle management
- Enable real-time streaming of flag changes to connected SDKs

### Won't
- Implement billing or subscription management
- Guarantee sub-millisecond evaluation latency at global scale

## Architecture Outline

- Core service in Rust or Node with Postgres plus Redis cache for rule storage
- Admin UI in Next.js using shared design system components
- Streaming gateway (WebSocket/SSE) distributing flag updates to SDKs

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Flag evaluation counters segmented by SDK, environment, and tenant
- Audit pipeline logging mutations with trace correlation IDs

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Rule evaluation bugs cause outages** — Adopt comprehensive unit tests and simulation environment mirroring production traffic
- **SDK drift leads to inconsistent behavior** — Version contracts via integration tests and publish compatibility matrix

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Model core domain, CRUD APIs, and deterministic evaluation engine
- Ship admin UI for flag management and seed SDK clients

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add streaming updates, audit logging, and tenant-aware rate limiting
- Instrument evaluations and publish dashboards for rollout health

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Introduce experiment analysis with conversion metrics
- Automate progressive rollouts with policy-driven guardrails
