# Context

Empower security teams to manage authorization policies centrally and roll out changes safely.

## Objectives

### Must
- Model policy bundles, environments, and deployment pipelines
- Integrate with OPA/Rego for evaluation and testing
- Provide UI for diffing policy changes and staging deployments

### Should
- Expose API/CLI for CI-driven policy promotion
- Track decisions and policy usage metrics for auditing

### Won't
- Replace identity providers or SSO platforms
- Provide fine-grained data masking policies beyond access control

## Architecture Outline

- FastAPI or Node backend managing policy bundles stored in Git-backed repo
- React admin interface with live policy evaluation sandbox
- Policy evaluation service running OPA in sidecar for pre-deployment tests

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Audit logs for policy changes, approvals, and rollbacks
- Latency metrics for policy evaluation in staging and production

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Policy errors block production traffic** — Implement staged rollouts, canary evaluation, and automatic rollback triggers
- **Lack of visibility into decision logs** — Aggregate decision logs into dashboards with search and retention policies

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Set up policy storage, evaluation sandbox, and deployment workflow
- Deliver UI for editing, diffing, and approving policies

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add CLI/API automation, audit trails, and metrics dashboards
- Integrate with external Git repos for policy version control

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Provide automated policy linting and compliance checks
- Introduce policy impact analysis and simulation tools
