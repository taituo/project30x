# Context

Automate compliance evidence gathering so security teams maintain continuous audit readiness.

## Objectives

### Must
- Ingest evidence from CI pipelines, Terraform state, and runtime audits
- Map evidence to control frameworks with coverage status tracking
- Provide reporting dashboards and export packages for auditors

### Should
- Support workflow for remediation tasks and owner assignments
- Integrate with ticketing systems for follow-up actions

### Won't
- Replace full-fledged GRC platforms
- Automatically approve or deny compliance certifications

## Architecture Outline

- Terraform evidence collectors and CI jobs publishing artifacts to central store
- Backend service normalizing evidence and mapping to controls
- UI for compliance officers to track status and generate reports

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Evidence freshness metrics and missing control alerts
- Audit log of control status changes and overrides

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Evidence gaps go unnoticed** — Implement automated reminders, dashboards, and Slack notifications
- **Data sensitivity requires careful handling** — Encrypt evidence at rest, enforce least privilege access, and log access attempts

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Build evidence ingestion pipeline and control mapping model
- Deliver dashboard summarizing compliance coverage

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Integrate remediation workflows, exports, and ticketing hooks
- Add alerting on stale evidence and missing controls

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Support automated auditor portal with scoped access
- Add policy-as-code integration to validate control adherence in CI
