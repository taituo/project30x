# Context

Support enterprise order flows spanning carts, payments, fulfillment, and notifications with resilient microservices.

## Objectives

### Must
- Model order lifecycle with services for cart, payment, fulfillment, and inventory
- Implement saga orchestration ensuring idempotency and compensation paths
- Expose GraphQL BFF for unified client access and monitoring

### Should
- Provide audit trails and event replay for recovery
- Support multi-region deployment with blue/green rollout strategies

### Won't
- Implement full ERP integration in v1
- Handle physical warehouse robotics integrations

## Architecture Outline

- Rust microservices communicating via Kafka or NATS event streams
- Temporal or custom saga orchestrator coordinating long-running flows
- Postgres databases with CQRS projections for query workloads

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Distributed tracing across saga steps with SLIs for each leg
- Business metrics dashboards (order success rate, fulfillment latency)

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Saga step failures lead to inconsistent state** — Implement idempotent handlers, compensation actions, and replayable logs
- **Event schema drift breaks services** — Version events and enforce schema registry checks in CI

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Define domain model, publish event schemas, and stand up core services
- Implement happy-path saga handling with integration tests

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add compensation paths, observability, and resiliency testing
- Document runbooks and failure-injection playbooks

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Introduce demand forecasting and inventory placement intelligence
- Enable multi-region deployments with traffic shifting and chaos exercises
