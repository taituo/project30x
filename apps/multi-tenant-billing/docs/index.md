# Context

Enable SaaS products to launch pricing experiments with minimal engineering overhead while maintaining compliance.

## Objectives

### Must
- Model tenants, subscriptions, usage events, and invoicing schedules
- Integrate with Stripe APIs for payments, webhooks, and customer management
- Provide admin UI for plan configuration and revenue analytics

### Should
- Support multiple tax regions and invoicing languages
- Expose reports for revenue recognition and churn tracking

### Won't
- Handle complex enterprise ERP integrations
- Offer on-premise deployment on day one

## Architecture Outline

- Next.js App Router front-end with server actions for admin operations
- Backend services storing billing data in Postgres with background workers for metering
- Webhook processors handling Stripe events and syncing state

## Observability & Quality Gates

- Dashboards showing payment success rates, retries, and revenue metrics
- Alerting on webhook failures and reconciliation mismatches

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Invoice inaccuracies damage trust** — Implement double-entry ledger and reconciliation tasks with unit and integration tests
- **Regulatory requirements change frequently** — Isolate tax logic and leverage Stripe Tax or external services with configuration flags

## Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Set up tenant models, plan catalog, and Stripe integration with webhook sync
- Deliver admin UI for basic billing flows and reporting dashboards

### Phase 2 – Polish
- Add tax localization, metered billing, and revenue analytics
- Strengthen observability and incident response playbooks

### Phase 3 – Stretch
- Implement usage scheduler with predictive forecasting
- Provide customer self-service portal and billing API
